# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.5] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- ACE registration in `~/.claude.json` now matches by extension version instead of exact script path, so the same install no longer looks "unregistered" when checked from a different editor (VS Code vs. Cursor) than it was set up from
- Standalone MCP server no longer exits fatally when one project's path is stale or missing — it logs a warning and keeps serving tools for every other project instead of dropping to zero tools
- MCP server registration no longer depends on the ACE sidebar being opened — added `onStartupFinished` so the extension (and its MCP server) activates on every window load
- Removed an advertised-but-unimplemented `resources` capability from the MCP handshake that caused Cursor to report 0 tools even though `tools/list` was working correctly

## [1.3.4] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Unified artifact scanning across MCP tools and the Workspaces tree** (spec 011): `.claude/` rules, commands, skills, and agent definitions are now included in `list_rules`/`list_commands`/`list_skills`/`list_agents` and `get_project` results, matching what the tree view already showed. `get_rule`/`get_command`/`get_skill`/`get_agent` resolve name collisions between `.cursor/` and `.claude/` via documented precedence (workspace before global, cursor before claude).

### Fixed
- Standalone MCP server: tool calls (`list_rules`, `get_rule`, etc.) were silently receiving no arguments due to a schema registration bug — fixed, and the registered server now knows about every workspace and added project so `projectKey` resolves correctly across all of them
- Skills directories are now watched recursively, so deleting an entire skill folder is caught (not just individual file edits)
- Global `~/.cursor/skills` and `~/.cursor/commands` are no longer automatically merged into a project's MCP results or Workspaces tree — the Agents view is the correct, dedicated place to browse global skill/command libraries

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- MCP section now uses a dedicated "mcp" icon instead of the generic "plug" icon in the Agents view

### Changed
- README rewritten with a clearer value proposition and expanded documentation for the MCP section, including a new troubleshooting entry for an empty MCP list

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- **MCP section in the Agents view** (spec 010): Claude Code and Cursor agent roots now display a read-only "MCP" section listing registered MCP servers by name, alongside Agents, Commands, and Skills (alphabetical ordering)
- **Startup prompt to register ACE with Claude Code** — on activation, if Claude Code is detected and ACE is not yet registered (or the registration is stale), ACE offers a one-time "Set up ACE for Claude Code MCP?" prompt that writes the stdio entry to `~/.claude.json`
- Live refresh of the MCP section when `~/.claude.json` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` change externally

### Fixed
- Pinned `@types/vscode` back to `^1.105.0` to match `engines.vscode` (required for Cursor compatibility) — resolves `vsce package` failing with `@types/vscode greater than engines.vscode`

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Release-prep automation skill for cutting releases from a branch without manual steps

### Fixed
- Single MCP server consolidation (spec 009): all MCP capabilities now served from a single unified endpoint
- `get_spec` exact-match priority — spec lookup now correctly prefers exact slug matches before falling back to partial matches

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Claude project agent definitions** — `.claude/agents/*.md` files are now scanned and displayed in the Workspaces tree under the Claude section as an "Agents" subsection (hubot icon, alphabetical, click-to-open). Mirrors the existing Cursor → Agents behaviour for project-level agent definitions.
- **File watcher for `.claude/agents/`** — the Workspaces tree automatically reflects additions, modifications, and deletions to project-level Claude agent files without a manual refresh.

### Changed
- **Conditional platform section display** — the Cursor section now appears in the Workspaces tree only when a `.cursor/` directory exists at the project root; the Claude section appears only when `.claude/` exists. Projects using a single agent platform no longer show an empty section for the other. The Specs node is unaffected and remains visible regardless of platform folder presence.
- Folder existence is detected via async `vscode.workspace.fs.stat()` in parallel with artifact scanning — no added latency to tree load.
- Living specs updated: `specs/providers/spec.md`, `specs/tree-view/spec.md`, `specs/scanners/spec.md` reflect the new category types and platform-gating behaviour.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Cursor artifacts (Rules, Commands, Skills, Agents) no longer fail to render in the Workspaces tree — a category id mismatch introduced in 1.1.0 caused the Cursor section to show empty
- Claude Code artifact groups (Rules, Commands, Skills) now display counts in the description column, matching Cursor's style

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Claude Code project-level file watchers — Agents view auto-refreshes when `~/.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, and `~/.claude/agents/` change
- Global (`.agents`) artifact file watchers — Agents view auto-refreshes for `~/.agents/commands/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, and `~/.agents/agents/`
- Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged — type check, unit tests, and scoped ESLint run automatically on every commit

### Fixed
- Global file watchers now use `vscode.RelativePattern(Uri.file(dir), glob)` instead of plain path strings — watchers outside the workspace were silently not firing

### Changed
- All six global watcher patterns (`.cursor`, `.claude`, `.agents`) follow a consistent symmetric implementation

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Added top-level release notes for 1.0.0 and aligned repository metadata for reviewer expectations.
- Expanded README quick-start guidance for Workspaces, Agents view, agent definitions, Specs, and MCP tool access.
- Added explicit compatibility requirement in README matching `engines.vscode`.

### Changed
- Clarified documentation so first-time users can validate capabilities without source spelunking.
- Aligned CD workflow with the 1.0.0 release process.
