# VS Code Extension UI/UX Guidelines

## Tree View Design

- Use meaningful icons from VS Code's icon set (`vscode.ThemeIcon`)
- Provide descriptive tooltips for tree items
- Group related items logically (by type, directory, or function)
- Use collapsible sections for better organization
- Implement proper context menus with relevant actions

## Command Design

- Use clear, action-oriented command names
- Provide helpful command descriptions in package.json
- Use appropriate icons for commands
- Group related commands in menus
- Implement keyboard shortcuts where appropriate

## User Feedback

- Show progress indicators for long operations
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Use appropriate message types (info, warning, error)
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle empty states gracefully with helpful messages

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements where applicable
- Provide alternative text for icons
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Use high contrast colors when possible
- Test with screen readers

## Performance

- Lazy load tree items when possible
- Implement efficient search and filtering
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists
- Minimize DOM updates
- Cache expensive computations
